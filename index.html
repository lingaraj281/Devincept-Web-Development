            <h2>Life</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Charles Robert Darwin was born in England on February 12, 1809 to Robert and Susannah Darwin. The Darwin family was wealthy and largely Unitarian. Charles Darwin attended a Unitarian chapel with his mother and five siblings. His mother died
                when he was just eight years old.</p>
            <p>In 1825, Darwin attended the University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother. He found his medical studies to be boring and instead found joy in studying natural-history. His father was angry that Charles was neglecting his medical
                studies, and so sent him to Cambridge to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>
            <p>In 1831, Darwin went on a five year voyage to chart the coastline of South America. Darwin spent most of his adventure on land - investigating geology and nature history. He took detailed notes and by the end of the voyage, had a diary of
                770 pages. He had also collected numerous specimens that he would later describe and publish his findings. Darwin's diary ended up being published as a journal. Between this journal and his specimen descriptions, Darwin became very well-known.</p>
            <p>Charles Darwin went deeper into his work on natural history and his own theory of evolution. Eventually, all his overworking caught up with him and Charles began having heart palpitations and stomach problems. But, he could not let his work
                get out - it was far too revolutionary and would upset people. So, Darwin continued to work and wrote up notes on his theory of natural selection.</p>
            <p>In 1839, Darwin married his cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Over the course of 18 years, he would have 10 children. Charles moved his family to an isolated village in 1842 so that he may continue work on theory in seclusion. He kept his work a secret
                as it would not go over well with most of society.</p>
            <p>Another English socialite, Alfred Wallace, had a similar theory to Charles Darwin. He agreed to share his findings along with Wallace at the Linnean Society, however Darwin missed the first public presentation due to the death of a child.
                Missing this presentation would go on to haunt Darwin.</p>
